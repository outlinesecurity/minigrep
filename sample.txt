Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety—ensuring that all references point to valid memory—without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent concurrent data races, its "borrow checker" tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compilation. Rust borrows ideas from functional programming, including static types, immutability, higher-order functions, and algebraic data types. It is popularized for systems programming.[12][13][14]

Software developer Graydon Hoare created Rust as a personal project while working at Mozilla Research in 2006. Mozilla officially sponsored the project in 2009. Since the first stable release in May 2015, Rust has been adopted by companies including Amazon, Discord, Dropbox, Facebook (Meta), Google (Alphabet), and Microsoft. In December 2022, it became the first language other than C and assembly to be supported in the development of the Linux kernel.
